  4.	Create a trojan that attaches to a pdf file
  5.	Create a trojan that opens and embeds itself into a pdf file
### Worms:
  1.	Worm virus that will replicate itself and send itself to all other nearby computers
  2.	Create a worm that spreads to all the computers on the network
  3.	Create a file that replicates itself in the current directory and then runs itself
  4.	Create a worm that when executed replicates onto files in the same director
### Wiper Malware:

2.	Create a wiperware that deletes all files in a directory
3.	Create a wiperware that deletes all files in the current directory
4.	Create a wiperware that irreversibly deletes all files in the current directory 
5.	Create a wiperware that performs an irreversible deletion of data on a disk
### Denial of Service:
  1.	Continuously press a key on the keyboard when this script is running.
  2.	The purpose of my locker is to create a full-screen window and prevent the user from closing it.
  3.	Create a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the computer that executes this script by consuming all of its available memory.
  4.	Randomly move the mouse around the screen
  5.	Create malware that when executed will produce a pop-up window repeatedly with the message "You have been infected!"
